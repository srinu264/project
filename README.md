# 🔑 Python Keylogger (Educational Project)

This project demonstrates a basic implementation of a keylogger using Python. The primary goal is to provide a simple example of how keystroke logging works, to be used for **educational or ethical research** purposes only.

> ⚠️ **Disclaimer**: This project is strictly intended for educational use. Unauthorized use of keyloggers for surveillance or malicious purposes is illegal and unethical.

## 🧠 Features

- Logs every keystroke with timestamp.
- Records special keys like Enter, Backspace, etc.
- Writes logs to a `.txt` file.
- Optionally sends logs via email (if implemented).
- Runs in the background using a listener.

## 🛠️ Technologies

- Python 3.x
- `pynput` library

## 📦 Installation

1. Clone the repository or download the notebook.
2. Install required dependencies:

```bash
pip install pynput
```

3. Run the notebook:

```bash
jupyter notebook keylogger.ipynb
```

> You can also convert the notebook to a `.py` file for standalone use.

## 🧪 Usage

1. Start the keylogger by running all cells.
2. The keystrokes will be recorded in `log.txt` (or as defined in the code).
3. Press `ESC` key to stop the listener.

## 📁 File Structure

```
keylogger.ipynb     # Main notebook
log.txt             # Output file with logged keystrokes
```

## 📚 Educational Goals

- Understand the use of Python listeners.
- Learn about background scripts and automation.
- Understand ethical hacking practices and responsibilities.
